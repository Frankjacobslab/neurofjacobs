fj74 SEQUENCES:

fj74 was sequenced as part of a pool that was sequenced on 2 lanes,
referred to as pools "P1" and "P2" on lanes L4 and L5.

At that time, the sequencing center was delivering all reads, including
those which failed to pass Illumina filters (marked as "Y").

In this directory, the files for each lane include only the "N" reads,
which did Not fail to pass the filters.

The _1.fastq.gz are read1
The _2.fastq.gz are read2

Counts were:

-----------------------------------------------------------------
fj95 and fj96 SEQUENCES:

At the time these were sequenced, the sequencing center delivered the
fastq files in files containing 4 million or fewer reads. (All files have 4M
except the highest numbered file.)

All of these reads were "N" (passed filter).

The _R1_ files are read1
The _R2_ files are read2
